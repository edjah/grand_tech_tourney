Problem 4: Two Sum
==================

Write a function called `two_sum(a, target)` which takes in an array of not-necessarily-distinct integers `a` and a target `target`. Your function should return `1` if there exist two numbers in `a` that sum to `target`. Your function should return `0` otherwise.
