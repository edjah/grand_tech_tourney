Problem 1: Search in a Sorted Array
===================================

You're given a zero-indexed, sorted array `a` with `n` unique integers values. You're also given an integer `i`. You must write a function `search(a, i)` that returns the index of `i` in `a`. If `i` is not a value that is contained in the array, `search(a, i)` must return `-1`.

The time complexity of `search` must be `O(log n)` at worst.
